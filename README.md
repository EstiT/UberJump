The tutorial was written in 2014 and has been moved to their archive but is still a good resource to learn how to make an iOS game with SpriteKit

Minor edits were made throughout. Many "magic numbers"/ non-dynamic elements were used that probably worked on older iPhones (i.e: screen co-ordinates/sizes). 

Tested on iPhone 6 and 7, first game does not fill the screen. Second game is not centred and is cut off.
